LIBFENC -- The Functional Encryption Library

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FENC library has a few dependancies, GMP and PBC libraries, which are found at:

    GMP http://www.swox.com/gmp/
    PBC http://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/news.html 

This library has been tested under Linux and Mac OS X with a fink/macports installation.
You may need to appropriately assign library and include paths to satisfy the above 
dependancies if not installed in the default /usr/ location.  See ./configure --help for
more help.

The common installation trial should look similar to:
./configure LDFLAGS=-L"/path/to/library/above" CPPFLAGS=-I"/path/to/includes/above"
make
make install


KNOWN ISSUES
---------------
Under the 64-bit Linux environment, we noted a problem with linking libraries that
were installed to /usr/local/lib/.  To mitigate this error, attempt a sudo ldconfig as your
first step.  This should link your libraries in.

Under MacOSX environment, if you have installed GMP via macports, you will run into a 
build error in libfenc concerning a missing gmp.h include.  To mitigate this error you 
will need to adjust the header, pbc.h, in the PBC source ./include/.  Modify the 
#include <gmp.h> to "/opt/local/include/gmp.h".
