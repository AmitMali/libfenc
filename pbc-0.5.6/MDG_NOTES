To build PBC on MacOS Leopard, 64-bit:

* Get the latest version of gmp, make sure configure is using it
* Copy "gmp.h" into this directory and comment out the following line:

  #define __GMP_EXTERN_INLINE extern __inline__ __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__))

  (NOTE: I've already done it in this directory.)

* At the command line, set "CPPFLAGS" and "CFLAGS" to "-m64"

  export CPPFLAGS="-m64"
  export CFLAGS="-m64"

 (in an earlier version, this was "-m64 -arch x86_64", but doesn't work now)

* Make clean and re-configure.

make clean
./configure
make
sudo make install

* It may be necessary to manually edit the Makefiles in the ./example 
  and ./gen directories to include the "-m64" directive in the CFLAGS definition.  

I've included special Makefiles in those directories, named "MDG_Makefile".  Just copy them over the Makefile that ./configure generated.

  I'm sure there's a way to get Configure to do this automatically,
  I'm just too lazy to figure it out.

This should give a 64-bit library with no problems...
